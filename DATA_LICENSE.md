\# Data Licensing — LUYS.OS LAB



This file describes the licensing model for datasets used in \*\*LUYS.OS LAB\*\*.



The repository contains two different kinds of assets:



1\. \*\*Open-source code\*\* (evaluation logic, metrics, helpers)

2\. \*\*Evaluation datasets\*\* (LAB-CORE-50 and future LAB-CORE-500 / LAB-EXT-5K)



---



\## 1. Code vs Data



\- All \*\*code\*\* in this repository is licensed under the terms of the main

&nbsp; project license (see `LICENSE`, currently MIT).



\- \*\*Datasets\*\* follow a stricter model and are \*\*not\*\* covered by the same

&nbsp; permissive license as the code.



This distinction is intentional: we want the evaluation \*logic\* to be open,

while keeping stronger control over how datasets are used and redistributed.



---



\## 2. Public sample: LAB-CORE-50



The file:



\- `core/antibenchmark/datasets/lab\_core\_50.json`



is a \*\*didactic sample dataset\*\* intended for:



\- research,

\- experimentation,

\- non-commercial prototyping,

\- demonstration of the LAB evaluation pipeline.



Unless stated otherwise, LAB-CORE-50 is provided under:



\- \*\*CC BY-NC 4.0\*\* (Attribution–NonCommercial)



This means:



\- ✅ You may \*\*use, copy, and modify\*\* the dataset for research and

&nbsp; non-commercial projects.

\- ✅ You must keep attribution to \*\*LUYS.OS LAB / LUYS AntiBenchmark\*\*.

\- ❌ You may \*\*not\*\* resell the dataset or use it as part of a commercial

&nbsp; product or paid service \*\*without a separate license from the authors\*\*.



If you are unsure whether your use case is “non-commercial”, treat it as

\*\*commercial\*\* and contact the authors.

\## 3. Private datasets: LAB-CORE-500, LAB-EXT-5K



Larger datasets mentioned in the documentation, such as:



\- \*\*LAB-CORE-500\*\*

\- \*\*LAB-EXT-5K\*\*



are \*\*not included\*\* in this public repository.



These sets are reserved for:



\- paid evaluations,

\- regulated-domain pilots (healthcare, law, finance),

\- research collaborations under NDA or a separate data use agreement.



They may include:



\- high-stakes domain scenarios,

\- expert annotations,

\- proprietary or sensitive patterns.



Access to these datasets is possible only through \*\*a separate contract\*\*.



---



\## 4. Trademark and naming



The names:



\- \*\*LUYS.OS LAB\*\*

\- \*\*LUYS AntiBenchmark\*\*

\- \*\*Sultan Index\*\*

\- \*\*Co-Thinking Mode (CTM)\*\*

\- \*\*REN / REN2 Resonance Metrics\*\*



are part of the project’s identity and may not be used to imply endorsement

or official certification \*\*without written permission\*\* from the authors.



You are welcome to say that you:



> “evaluated a model using LUYS.OS LAB–inspired methods”



but \*\*official “LUYS LAB certified” badges or labels require an explicit

agreement\*\*.



---



\## 5. Contact



For commercial licensing, data access, or joint research:



\- open an Issue in the repository; or

\- use the contact listed in the project description (GitHub profile).



We intentionally keep the \*\*evaluation logic open\*\*, and \*\*data controlled\*\*,

to balance transparency with safety and responsible use.
