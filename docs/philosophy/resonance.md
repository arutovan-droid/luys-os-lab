\# REN (Resonance) Philosophy — Draft



REN (Resonance) is the LUYS.OS metric that measures how well a model's answer

fits the structure of domain reality and the user's context.



It is not about "fluency" of text, but about:



\- semantic depth (going beyond clichés),

\- alignment with domain knowledge and records,

\- non-banality (low banality\_index),

\- and consistency with protocols and constraints.



In the LAB spec we use a simplified semantic REN:



REN\_semantic = (semantic\_depth + contextual\_alignment + (1 - banality\_index)) / 3



This document will later describe:



\- how we estimate each component,

\- examples for medicine, law, finance,

\- and how REN integrates with LUYS.OS memory / Truth Layer.
